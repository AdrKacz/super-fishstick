Let's build a Twitter Bot with ChatGPT ðŸ¤–

I will use ChatGPT to create a Twitter bot. I will only prompt it and execute its answers. If it needs to code and it makes error, I won't correct the code myself, instead I will tell it about the errors and let it correct it self.
The objective is to play with ChatGPT and have fun time while discovering a new technology I never used before: Twitter bots.

The project will be completed if
  - it posts regurlarly on Twitter auto-generated content,
  - it attracts at least ten new followers in the first two weeks,
  - it doesn'st post offended content
